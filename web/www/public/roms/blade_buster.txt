Blade Buster
by High Level Challenge

It is produced within the constraints of the NES in fact, it runs on emulator
and the operation of the actual machine has also been confirmed.

You have 2 minutes in a caravan format to compete the score at 5 minutes. It has
become a game with a sense of exhilaration that has good old shoot before being
shot playing style.
