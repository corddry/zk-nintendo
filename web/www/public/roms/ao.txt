AO
by Second Dimension

AO is a homebrew puzzle game. Each of the 33 levels consists of a fixed, single
screen environment where a brick needs to be guided to a goal pit (exit point)
in a maze-like environment shown through a top-down view. The brick is
controlled directly and the view is in 2D, but the player needs to think in 3D
to solve the puzzle. The brick takes up two spaces when it is laying on its side
and one space when it is standing up. To get around in the maze the brick often
needs to be brought into a specific position so it can move without falling off
the edge. For instance: some passages only have room for a single space and then
the brick cannot pass unless it is in a good position. When falling off the
ledge the level restarts right away and there are unlimited lives. Gradually
additional elements are introduced such as switches, teleportation blocks and
weak floors. The game contains a competitive two-player mode where two players
move through the maze simultaneously with the goal to reach the exit first. The
game provides 1,000 seconds to complete the game, but it is possible to continue
playing even when time has run out.
