From Below
by Matt Hughson

FROM BELOW is a falling block puzzle game featuring:

Soft Drops Hard Drops Wall Kicks T-Spins Lock Delay 3 modes of play: Kraken
Battle Mode

The signature mode of FROM BELOW. Battle the Kraken by clear lines across the
onslaught of attacking Kraken Tentacles. The Tentacles push more blocks onto the
screen every few seconds, forcing to act quickly, and strategize on an every
changing board.

Classic Mode

The classic block falling mechanics you know and love without any new
gimicks. Modernize for 2020, with Hard Drops, Lock Delay, and more, making this
(hopefully) the best feeling puzzle game on the NES!

Turn Based Kraken Battle Mode

Similar to “Kraken Battle Mode”, but instead of the Kraken attacking every few
seconds, it advances its tentacle every time you drop a piece. Make every move
count, as this move favors slow, deliberate play!
